# BayesianAnalysis
Semesterproject work for the lecture Bayesian Statistics and Probabilistic Machine Learning.

## Content

We downloaded data from the Spotify API and used it to predict whether an indie song is going to be a hit.
This project was done mainly using R and especially [brms](https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms).

## Results

The computed models and results can be seen on the [nextcloud](https://nextcloud.stuvus.uni-stuttgart.de/s/PATmxyqXbca9g29).

## Contributers

[Andrei Chalapco](github.com/andreichalapco/) and [Magnus Ostertag](https://github.com/MagnusOstertag).
